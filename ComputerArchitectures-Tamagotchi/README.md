# Computer architectures project
This project was made during Computer architectures course, it was useful to understand how high level programming languages
interface with low-level hardware. We reproduced that behaviour by creating some libraries (in C) to modify the bits and then we used them
in order to create a very famous game: Tamagotchi.
