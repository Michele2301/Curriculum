# EZWallet

This project was part of the Software engineering course, it's purpose was writing a full functional backend with all its documentation (Waterfall model) and its tests.

During all the waterfall phases we had to face multiple changes in the requirements, teaching us what usually happens in the real world and how much is difficult to update all the project
when it is already written.

This was the main application purpose:

EZWallet is a web application designed to help individuals and families keep track of their 
expenses. Users can enter and categorize their expenses, allowing them to quickly see where their 
money is going. EZWallet is a powerful tool for those looking to take control of their finances and 
make informed decisions about their spending.
