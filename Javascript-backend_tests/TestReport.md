# Dependency graph 

     <report the here the dependency graph of EzWallet>
<img src="./UML/images/dependency_graph.jpg"></img>

     
# Integration approach

    <Write here the integration sequence you adopted, in general terms (top down, bottom up, mixed) and as sequence
    (ex: step1: unit A, step 2: unit A+B, step 3: unit A+B+C, etc)> 
    <Some steps may  correspond to unit testing (ex step1 in ex above)>
    <One step will  correspond to API testing, or testing unit route.js>
Bottom up approach was used for integration testing. The following steps were followed:
we tested before all the mongoose models and the verifyAuth which are the base of the application.
Then we tested auth.js for having a simple way to insert the tokens used by the verifyAuth in the database
Then we tested user.js and controller.js


# Tests

   <in the table below list the test cases defined For each test report the object tested, the test level (API, integration, unit) and the technique used to define the test case  (BB/ eq partitioning, BB/ boundary, WB/ statement coverage, etc)>   <split the table if needed>
